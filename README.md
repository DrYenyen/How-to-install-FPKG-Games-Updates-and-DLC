pkg = Official game, update or dlc file a normal pkg that checks the user who launches the app has a license to run.

# The PS4 system game structure  
1 The product code is distinct to a region, and the common codes youâ€™ll see are CUSA, PCAS, and PLAS.      
It is followed by a unique number ID.        
R1 USA-*CUSA*       
R2 Europe-*CUSA*         
R3 Asia-*PLAS*, *PCAS*    
         
For example Minecraft USA is *CUSA00744* while Minecraft EU is *CUSA00265*              
Another example Resident Evil 2, USA is *CUSA09193* while Asia is *PLAS10335*
